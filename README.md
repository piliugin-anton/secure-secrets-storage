# Secure Secrets Storage (AI vibe-coding demo)
## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION ⚠️⚠️⚠️

A cryptographically secure, file-based secrets manager with comprehensive security features including rollback attack protection, encrypted audit logging, and key rotation capabilities.

## Features

### 🔐 Strong Cryptography
- **XChaCha20-Poly1305** authenticated encryption (256-bit keys)
- **Argon2id** password-based key derivation (256MB memory, GPU-resistant)
- **HMAC-SHA256** for authentication and integrity verification
- **HKDF** for secure key derivation with domain separation

### 🛡️ Security Hardening
- **Rollback attack protection** via monotonic counter with HMAC authentication
- **Memory security**: automatic zeroization of sensitive data, memory locking (Unix)
- **Secure file permissions**: owner-only read/write (0600 on Unix, ACL on Windows)
- **Core dump prevention** (Unix systems)
- **Atomic file operations** with exclusive locking to prevent corruption

### 📊 Audit & Compliance
- **Encrypted audit log** with tamper detection
- Comprehensive operation tracking (reads, writes, deletes, key rotations)
- Timestamped entries with success/failure status
- Audit log encryption tied to vault passphrase

### 🔄 Key Management
- **Key rotation** without passphrase change (re-encrypts with new salt)
- **Emergency rotation** with automatic verification
- **Passphrase change** with secure rekeying of all components
- Automatic backup creation before critical operations

### 💾 Backup & Recovery
- **Encrypted backups** with HMAC verification
- **Export/Import** functionality (plaintext JSON for migration)
- **Vault verification** command for integrity checks
- Atomic restore with pre-restore backup

```bash
secure-secrets-storage list-users
Enter users database passphrase: ****
```

Output:
```bash
=== Users ===

### Security Features

- ✅ **Argon2id password hashing** - GPU-resistant, 64MB memory per hash
- ✅ **Per-user vault passphrase encryption** - Each user's password encrypts vault access
- ✅ **Session management** - 30-minute token expiration with auto-refresh
- ✅ **Account lockout** - 5 failed attempts = 15-minute lock
- ✅ **Role-based access control** - Granular permissions per user
- ✅ **Encrypted user database** - Protected by master passphrase
- ✅ **Audit logging** - All authentication events tracked

### Architecture
```
User Login
    ↓
Password → Argon2id hash verification
    ↓
Decrypt vault passphrase (unique per user)
    ↓
Create session token (UUID, 30min expiration)
    ↓
All API requests: Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ↓
Role-based permission check
    ↓
Access vault with decrypted passphrase
```

### Shared Vault Model

All users share the same vault but authenticate separately:
- One encrypted vault containing all secrets
- Each user has the vault passphrase encrypted with their own password
- Role-based permissions control read/write/delete access
- Ideal for team secrets: API keys, DB passwords, shared credentials

### Files Created
```
vault.enc           # Encrypted secrets (shared by all users)
vault.counter       # Rollback protection
vault_audit.log     # Encrypted audit log
users.db            # Encrypted user database
```

## File Structure

```
vault.enc           # Encrypted secrets storage
vault.counter       # Monotonic counter for rollback protection
vault_audit.log     # Encrypted audit log
```

## Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO
- Use a **strong, unique passphrase** (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Keep **regular encrypted backups** in a secure location
- **Verify vault integrity** periodically with `verify` command
- **Rotate keys** annually or after suspected compromise
- **Check file permissions** regularly with `check-permissions`
- Store vault files on **encrypted storage** (full disk encryption)

### ❌ DON'T
- Share your passphrase or store it in plaintext
- Store vault files on networked/cloud storage without additional encryption
- Use the `export` command unless absolutely necessary (creates plaintext file)
- Run the application with elevated privileges unless required for memory locking
- Modify vault files directly (always use the application)

## Architecture

### Cryptographic Design

```
Passphrase (user input)
    ↓
Argon2id (256MB memory, 3 iterations)
    ↓
Master Key (64 bytes)
    ↓
HKDF-SHA256 (domain separation)
    ↓
├─ Encryption Key (32 bytes) → XChaCha20-Poly1305
└─ Authentication Key (32 bytes) → HMAC-SHA256
```

### File Format

**Vault File** (`vault.enc`):
```
[1 byte: version]
[8 bytes: counter (little-endian)]
[32 bytes: random salt]
[24 bytes: XChaCha20 nonce]
[32 bytes: HMAC-SHA256]
[variable: ciphertext]
```

**Counter File** (`vault.counter`):
```
[8 bytes: counter (little-endian)]
[32 bytes: HMAC-SHA256(counter)]
```

### Rollback Protection

1. Counter incremented **before** vault write
2. If vault write fails, next read detects counter > vault_counter
3. Attacker replacing vault with old version triggers: stored_counter > vault_counter
4. System rejects operation and alerts user

### Concurrency Model

- **Exclusive locks** for write operations (one writer at a time)
- **Shared locks** for read operations (multiple concurrent readers)
- **File-based locking** (flock on Unix, LockFileEx on Windows)
- Atomic operations with temp files + rename

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (sequential to avoid OOM)
cargo test -- --test-threads=1

# Run specific test module
cargo test concurrency_tests -- --test-threads=1

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture

# Check code coverage (requires cargo-tarpaulin)
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Cryptographic operations (encryption, decryption, key derivation)
- ✅ Rollback attack detection
- ✅ Tampering detection
- ✅ Concurrent access (multiple readers, write contention)
- ✅ Crash recovery scenarios
- ✅ Backup and restore
- ✅ Import/export functionality
- ✅ Permission handling (Unix and Windows)
- ✅ Audit log encryption and rekeying

## Performance

- **Key derivation**: ~1-2 seconds per operation (intentionally slow, GPU-resistant)
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Sub-millisecond for typical vault sizes (<1MB)
- **File I/O**: Optimized with buffered readers/writers
- **Memory**: ~256MB during key derivation, minimal during normal operations

## Platform Support

| Platform | Encryption | Rollback Protection | File Locking | Secure Permissions | Memory Locking |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Linux    | ✅        | ✅                  | ✅ (flock)   | ✅ (chmod 0600)   | ✅            |
| macOS    | ✅        | ✅                  | ✅ (flock)   | ✅ (chmod 0600)   | ✅            |
| Windows  | ✅        | ✅                  | ✅ (LockFileEx) | ✅ (ACL)       | ⚠️ (limited)  |
| BSD      | ✅        | ✅                  | ✅ (flock)   | ✅ (chmod 0600)   | ✅            |

## Limitations

- **Single vault per directory**: The application uses fixed filenames (`vault.enc`, etc.)
- **No network sync**: Designed for local storage only (API provides network access)
- **Shared vault model**: All authenticated users access the same vault (role-controlled)
- **Performance**: Argon2id is intentionally slow (security vs. convenience trade-off)
- **Session storage**: Sessions stored in memory only (restart clears all sessions)

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to acquire exclusive lock"
Multiple processes are accessing the vault. Wait for other operations to complete.

### "Rollback attack detected"
The vault file is older than the counter file. This could indicate:
- Restored from old backup without restoring counter
- Attempted rollback attack
- File system corruption

**Solution**: Use the most recent backup or verify vault integrity.

### "Authentication failed - wrong passphrase or tampered data"
Either:
- Incorrect passphrase entered
- Vault file has been modified/corrupted
- Wrong vault file being accessed

### "Insecure file permissions"
Vault files are readable by other users.

**Solution**: Run `check-permissions` command to fix automatically.

### "Maximum concurrent sessions exceeded"
User has reached the session limit (default: 5 per user).

**Solution**: Logout from unused sessions or wait for sessions to expire (30 minutes).

### "Account locked due to failed login attempts"
Too many failed login attempts (5+ failures).

**Solution**: Wait 15 minutes for automatic unlock, or contact admin to manually unlock.

### "Invalid or expired session"
Session token has expired or is invalid.

**Solution**: Login again to get a new session token.
